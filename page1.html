    <p class="back">BACKGROUND</p>
    <p> I am currently a Junior at Eastern Greene High School.
        My plan for the future is to go to college for art and web development degrees while learning new coding languages. I want to work as a web developer and designer. I use my skills best in some of my favorite programs such as Visual studio code, Microsoft Excel, and Notepad ++.
        So far I only know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The easiest for me out of the three is HTML and CSS.

    <p> Some of my favorite hobbies are drawing, reading, and coding of course. I love to hang out with my friends and do various things alongside them.
        I also like to so bird watching and raise animals. I currently have three cats and a dog.
